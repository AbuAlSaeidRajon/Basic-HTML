    <p> Agra is one of the most visited cities in India for a reason. Home to the iconic Taj Mahal, a magnificent wonder of the world, it is a former capital of India that welcomes millions of tourists every year, eager to visit the country’s most famous monument. Though there is plenty more to experience for those willing to stick around for more than a day.<br><br> 
        Boasting a plethora of Mughal tombs and gardens, the historically rich city of Agra is an integral part of India’s Golden Triangle. With three UNESCO World Heritage Sites and dozens of lesser known landmarks under its belt, there is plenty to captivate visiting photographers, travellers and historians to this part of Uttar Pradesh. <br><br>

        So, if you are planning to visit Agra and are wondering what else is there to see beyond the Taj Mahal, then worry not. I spent four days there in October 2021, and am happy to share up-to-date information to help you plan your dream Agra trip. In this guide, you’ll find everything from where to stay to what to see in Agra and much more.<br><br></p>

    <h1>Where is Agra?</h1>

    <p> Located on the banks of Yamuna river, Agra is a city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is approximately 210 km south of India’s capital city, New Delhi, and 240 km east of Jaipur in Rajasthan. If grouped together, these three cities make North India’s Golden triangle, the most popular tourist route in the country.<br><br> But should you have more time on hand, the heritage arc of Uttar Pradesh, including Agra, Lucknow, and Varanasi is also worth checking out. Lucknow is situated at a distance of around 335 km from Agra and has been on my bucket list since so long! </p>

    <h1> How to get to Agra? </h1>

    <p> Being one of the top bucket list destinations in India, Agra is well-connected to other Indian cities by an extensive rail and road network. There is also a domestic airport in Agra, but it is usually more convenient to fly to New Delhi or Jaipur due to more frequent flight options.<br><br> From those cities, you can take a taxi to Agra or hop on a train. Agra has several train stations, out of which Agra Cantonment (Agra Cantt) and Agra Fort are closer to the city centre. The Gatimaan Express from Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station in New Delhi only takes 1 hour and 40 minutes to reach Agra Cantonment.

    Alternatively, you can also take your own car or book a private taxi and reach Agra at your convenience. The roads connecting Agra with both New Delhi and Jaipur are in good condition and the drive is pretty smooth and easy. Depending on how early you leave and the route taken, you can get from Jaipur to Agra in approximately four to six hours.<br><br>
    My friend and I booked a taxi from Savaari car rentals for this trip. They are an online cab aggregator in India that provides affordable chauffeur driven taxis in various cities across the country. Their expertise regarding road trips in India is really valuable, especially when going to off-beat places. I used their service to go from Kolkata to Odisha as well and loved that their quoted price includes tolls, state tax and GST so there are no surprises in the end. Check prices for their Jaipur to Agra cab here.<br><br>
    Although trains to Agra take less time to reach, it may make sense for you economically to book a taxi when travelling in a group. But if on a tighter budget, there are also frequent buses that go to Agra daily. You can check the timing and prices for buses to Agra on redBus.</p>
